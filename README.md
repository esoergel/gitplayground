## Git Playground

This is a collection of test files for people to use to play around with git in a language/framework-agnostic environment.  
The instructions directory contains 5 files that walk through git commands that should cover all the basics for working with git on your own and as part of a group.  I made a [walkthrough](https://github.com/esoergel/meta/wiki/Git-Walkthrough) for my coderaising group that was well received, so I decided to make this as a more general, language-agnostic learning tool.

#### Instructions:

 1. [Getting Started](instructions/1-getting_started.md) - How to get a copy of this repo to work with on your computer.

 1. [Poking Around](instructions/2-poking_around.md) - 
    Git basics - branching, saving changes

 1. [Merging and History](instructions/3-merging_and_history.md)
 
    Combining branches, poking through the commit history and checking out previous versions of the code.

 1. [Collaboration Concepts](instructions/4-collaboration_concepts.md)
    
    Code-free, high-level look at using git in a team environment, or for contributing to an open source project.

 1. [Collaborating](instructions/collaborating.md)
    
    Walkthrough of commands and steps useful when collaborating.


#### Future plans
I'd like to add a brief command reference for these and other commands at some point.
